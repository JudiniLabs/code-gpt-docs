 CodeGPT is a powerful extension harnessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to boost your programming tasks using AI. This tool not only allows you to interact with your work environment dynamically but can also create AI Agents that enrich LLMs with context and connect you with repositories, reports, and other critical areas of your business. 
 
 In this tutorial, we'll guide you through downloading and setting up CodeGPT, and show you some typical use cases, so you can seamlessly integrate it into your coding workflow. 
 
 Let's get started and dive right into the AI-enhanced coding experience!

:::caution

While the CodeGPT extension is free, it requires you to use an API from an external provider (see [Providers](/docs/category/ai-providers)). **These external providers are paid services**, although they may offer limited usage for free.
