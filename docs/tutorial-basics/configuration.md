### Code Graph (Teams Plan Only)
Click on `Code Graph` to connect your Knowledge Graph from CodeGPT Studio and leverage it as context for your conversations.

With this feature, the agent gains access to the **Knowledge Graph Tool**, which enables searching for nodes and edges based on their semantic relationships.

### ü§î What's the Difference?
What is the difference between Codebase Indexing and simply highlighting text for context? Here's a quick guide to help you decide:

**Use Highlighting When:**
- You're focused on a small snippet or a specific bug
- You don't want to grant access to your entire project
- You need quick, one-off explanations

**Use Codebase Indexing When:**
- You want CodeGPT to understand and work with your entire project
- You need context-aware suggestions, navigation, or implementations
- You're working on larger features, refactors, or debugging across multiple files
- You want access to advanced tools like Semantic Search and Knowledge Graphs

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Context Settings

### Global
- Enable options to automatically add the current file as context, or configure the model to start responses with a To-Do list.

### MCP
- Add your MCP integration. For more information, check [here](https://docs.codegpt.co/docs/tutorial-features/mcp).

### Internal Tools
