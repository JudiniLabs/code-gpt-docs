# Troubleshooting

## CodeGPT VSCode Extension Troubleshooting Guide

### Introduction

This guide is designed to help you resolve common issues that may arise during the installation and use of the CodeGPT extension. Before you begin, ensure that you meet all the necessary requirements and configurations outlined below.

### Requirements

To run the CodeGPT extension, your setup must meet the following requirements:

- VSCode Version: Your VSCode must be version 1.82.0 or higher.
- Node.js Version: Your Node.js must be version 18.0.0 or higher.

### Common Issues and Solutions

- Issue:
The CodeGPT extension requires the use of port 54112 for localhost. If this port is not available, the extension will fail to run.

- Solution:
Ensure that port 54112 is free and not being used by any other application. You can check and free up this port by using the following commands:

For Windows:

```
netstat -aon | findstr :54112
taskkill /F /PID <PID>
```

For macOS and Linux:

```
lsof -i :54112
kill -9 <PID>
```
Replace `<PID>` with the actual Process ID using the port.


### Using devcontainer

- Issue:
When using a devcontainer, port **54112** must be opened in the docker-compose configuration.

- Solution:
Ensure that your docker-compose.yml includes the following configuration to open port 54112:

```
services:
  your-service-name:
    ports:
      - "54112:54112"
```

### VSCode Tunnel Incompatibility

- Issue:
The CodeGPT extension is incompatible with VSCode Tunnel as it cannot run localhost under this setup.

- Solution:
Unfortunately, no workaround exists for using the CodeGPT extension with VSCode Tunnel. Please make sure you run VSCode in a local environment where localhost can be used.

## Experiencing a black screen after reinstalling or updating the CodeGPT Extension
- Issue:
The CodeGPT extension requires cache clearance after reinstallation or an update.

-Solution: Delete cache memory
```

- Press Ctrl + Shift + P
- Type command "Clear Editor History"
- Press Enter
- Shut VSCode and install CodeGPT again
```

## Unable to connect to the extension services
- Issue:
After installation, the CodeGPT extension requires restarting the environment.

-Solution:
You can try these alternatives:
```
- Restart your computer
- Delete cache memory 
- Verify the availability of port 54112 or 54113.
```

## Can't use the Marketplace agents
- Issue:
The number of agents you can install from the Marketplace is limited based on your subscription plan. Therefore, you may encounter an error message stating, "You have reached the limit of agents."

- Solution:
Please remove all excess agents, retaining only the quantity permitted under your current subscription plan.
