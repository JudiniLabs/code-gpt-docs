### Context level

Please enable it, and AI will be able to understand the context of your code. 

You have three levels of context:

- `Selected code`: manually selected code
- `Codebase`: we auto-select the codebase. Please index the codebase before on the `Codebase` button
- `Deep insights`: we enrich the responses with code knowledge graphs.

## Using Custom Context
Using custom contexts allows you to tailor the responses to specific situations.
