# Vision

The Vision button is a powerful tool that allows you to analyze images and extract meaningful information. 

## How to use

- Please ensure that you have established a connection with CodeGPT Plus or Ollama.
- Upload an image to use as a prompt for the model (only .jpg, .png, .webp format).

You can identify and locate objects within the image, the model can then provide details such as the type of object, its position, size, and even its color.

:::note Ask about the text within the images
