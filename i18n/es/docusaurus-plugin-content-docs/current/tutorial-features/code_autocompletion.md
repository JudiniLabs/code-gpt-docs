# Code Autocompletion - New

## Description
The Code Autocompletion with Model Selection feature empowers you to choose from a curated selection of models including those from OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and Google Makersuite. This advanced tool enhances your coding experience by providing accurate and contextually relevant code suggestions.

## How to Use:
- Autocomplete Settings:
    - Check the option âœ… **Enable CodeGPT Copilot**
    - **Max Tokens:** The maximum number of tokens to generate. The model will stop once this many tokens have been generated, so this value trades off between latency and coherence.
    - **Provider:**
        - OpenAI - gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct
        - Anthropic - claude-2
        - Anthropic - claude-instant-1
        - Ollama - codellama
        - Google - text-bison-001 (english only)
    - **Suggestion Delay:** The delay in milliseconds between the last character typed and the request for suggestions.
